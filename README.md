A Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning.  The idea behind this at least for now is to install it on a RPI3 or better device and monitor network devices.  Down the road, writing a Windows Packet Filter to send the data back to the "server" for processing.

All the while, displaying an awesome mobile experience for you on the go.
